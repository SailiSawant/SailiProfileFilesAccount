## Where am I from?
I am born and brought up in Mumbai, India. I came to USA for pursuing my Master of Science in Illinois Institute of Technology,Chicago.

## My IT background
I felt really privileged when I got the opportunity to work in both the technical and functional backgrounds for SAP Basis and SAP Master Data management for Capgemini an IT firm.
The first project that I was involved in was to provide SAP support for client-firm Schneider Electrics using SAP Basis.
It dealt with systems which included technical and OS-level backup support which contained description of the issue from Schneider’s as well as Bayer’s business perspective. 
I gained tremendous learning from this activity such as ensuring that the SAP application server and applications were installed with precise configurations and that they functioned smoothly without any hitches. 
I worked as an It Intern at a food company called OSI Group in aurora where I learnt SAP Sales and distribution module during my summer internship.

## Something interesting about me 
I am a very social person, like to meet new people, talk about new things, explore and I love to travel new places. 
I like to sing, listen to music and dance, watch TV-series.
I like to do a lot of shopping , so you can call me a shopoholic. I love my parents and my friends. I am very fun-loving, kind and care for others.
